<h3 style="margin-top: 0">Preparation</h3>

<p>The MAT program is intended for students who have a strong background in the arts, science, or engineering (for example, visual arts, film/video, music, computer science, material science, mechanical engineering, or electrical and computer engineering), and who wish to earn a degree that integrates art and engineering. Prospective students should be ambitious and curious about intermedia art and should be interested in working on group projects and research.</p>

<p>An undergraduate degree (major discipline) in art, music, computer science, engineering, or another relevant field is required. Students are expected to have basic preparation including calculus-level mathematics. UCSB graduate students already enrolled in other degree programs may petition to add the MAT degree as a second degree objective.</p>

<p>Applicants should also be able to demonstrate a basic level of proficiency in a MAT cross-discipline. For example, a student's major discipline is in the creative arts, their cross-discipline may be science or engineering. If a student's major discipline is in science or engineering, their cross-discipline may be one of the creative arts.</p>

<p>Applications will be evaluated by MAT faculty members from engineering and the arts.  Students who are admitted to the program may be required to complete coursework to reinforce their cross-disciplinary competence during the first year. The department's admission policy is based on intellectual potentials and promise, academic records and programmatic fit. Graduate admission is an academic decision involving factors beyond scores and grades.</p>

<p>
MAT offers Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in Media Arts and Technology. For a list of MAT faculty and researchers, visit the <a class="text_link" href="http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/faculty.php">Faculty and Researchers page</a>. For more information on the primary areas of research, visit the <a class="text_link" href="http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/research.php">Research in MAT page</a>.
</p>

<p>Students may be admitted to the MAT PhD program in one of three ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>
With an MS degree in Media Arts and Technology. Current MAT MS students may petition for entry into the PhD program. The petition should consist of a new statement of purpose and new letters of reference. Former MAT students must apply via the regular application process.
</li>
<li>
With an MS or MA degree in a related field (e.g., art, architecture, music, computer science, or electrical and computer engineering). These students must complete or place out of the MAT core courses, or complete other coursework as determined by the MAT faculty.
</li>
<li>
With a Bachelor's degree, for outstanding well-prepared students. These students must meet the requirements for the MAT Master's degree along the way, including a thesis or project, and will receive an MS degree in the process.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For a student entering with a Master's degree, the time to PhD is typically three to four years. Starting with a Bachelor's degree, the requirements for the PhD are typically completed within four to six years.

<h4>Online Portfolio Website</h4>
<p>
The portfolio is submitted as a link to a website, or part of a website, that is designed by the applicant, that documents the applicant’s accomplishments. Portfolios will differ according to the applicant’s background and interests; an ideal portfolio will exhibit both depth and interdisciplinary breath. Examples of portfolio content include:
</p>

<li>Other significant project work (individual or group) in software, hardware/devices, or art/music works.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Portfolio Link Visibility: </strong> Please note that, in the interest of openness and transparency in the admissions process, applicant portfolio links will be made visible to current MAT faculty and students. If an applicant wishes to provide confidential portfolio materials for review by the Admissions Committee only,  then the applicant must state this clearly and must provide separate, confidential links for this purpose. This issue only pertains to portfolio links. All other application materials are confidential and will only be reviewed by the Admissions Committee.</p>

<h3>International Students</h3>

<h4>Language Requirements</h4>

<p>There are no foreign language requirements for Media Arts and Technology graduate degrees.</p>

<h4>English Language Placement Examination (ELPE)</h4>

<p>
All non-native speakers, including those who have degrees from U.S. institutions, must take UCSB's
English Language Placement Examination (ELPE) at the beginning of the first term enrolled (refer to the
General Catalog). The ELPE is UCSB's way of checking for minimal oral and written proficiency in
English. It is a ninety-minute essay test, and a fifteen-minute oral interview with an ESL instructor
(English as a Second Language). Based on the results of the ELPE, the ESL instructor may recommend
that a student take one or more ESL courses. Doing well on the ELPE does not certify a student for duties
as a Teaching Assistant. Certification for TA duties is done through the Graduate Division.
</p>

<h4>Graduate Division TA Certification Interview</h4>

<p>
For non-native English speakers it is necessary to pass a TA certification interview in order to serve as a
TA at UCSB, regardless of where previous degrees were earned. This interview is attended by the head of
Graduate Division's Academic Services Department, an instructor from the ESL program (English as a
Second Language), and a member of the Department, who clarifies for the others the nature of the teaching
duties. The interview involves teaching a ten-minute mock lesson and responding to impromptu questions
from those present.
</p>

<h4>Office of International Students and Scholars</h4>

<p>
<a class="text_link" href="http://www.oiss.ucsb.edu" target="_blank">The Office of International Students and Scholars</a> (OISS) serve the international student population, which
is quite diverse in its belief systems, values, traditions and academic training. Additionally, OISS assists
foreign postdoctoral scholars engaged in research at UCSB with matters relating to visas. The OISS staff
members advise and assist students with concerns about immigration, finances, employment, academic
work, housing and personal problems. OISS works with volunteers from the Santa Barbara community
who teach English-language conversation classes and offer individual conversation tutorials in OISS
classrooms throughout the year. OISS administers an Orientation Program for entering foreign students,
publishes a quarterly newsletter and maintains information of interest to international students and scholars at its web site. Email: oiss(at)sa.ucsb.edu. Phone: (805) 893-2929.
